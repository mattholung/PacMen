# PacMen
This was one of my assignments for the MIT XPRO course for Week 7. This includes 4 pictures representing the 2 states of each pacman in both directions. Have fun watching PacMen bounce along the walls of your browser! Create as many pacmen as you would like! I do not own any of rights for any of these files! They belong to MIT. Please see the License file located within this repository.
# Future
In the future, I plan on adding a remove button and a background. I also plan on adding a feature that mirrors pacman when he bounces off of the wall to make it look like he is traveling in the opposite direction.
